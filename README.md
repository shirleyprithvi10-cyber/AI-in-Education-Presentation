Application of AI in Education
ABSTRACT
The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) has transitioned from science fiction to a central component of modern pedagogical infrastructure. This report synthesises current research to explore how AI is revolutionising learning, instruction, and administration. AI in this context refers to machines capable of mimicking human cognitive functions, such as learning, problem-solving, and adaptability. The core promise of AIEd lies in personalised learning, which allows educational content to adapt to the unique pace and needs of individual students. Key technologies include Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which provide immediate feedback, and Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, which enables human-like dialogue for instructional support.
However, the "black box" of AI presents significant technical and ethical challenges. Issues of algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the potential for diminished human interaction remain critical concerns for stakeholders. Furthermore, while developed nations like the USA and China lead in AI investments, there are growing risks of an "equity gap" if access to these technologies is not democratised. Future trends point towards the integration of neuroscience, swarm intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to create even more immersive and effective learning environments. Ultimately, AI is viewed not as a replacement for teachers, but as a powerful tool to empower them, shifting their role from primary knowledge providers to facilitators of deeper learning.
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Definition and Scope of AI in Education
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is traditionally defined as the science of making machines perform tasks that would require intelligence if done by humans, such as perception, reasoning, and learning. In the educational sector, AIEd (Artificial Intelligence in Education) has become a multidisciplinary field absorbing ideas from computer science, cognitive science, neurology, and philosophy. It encompasses a wide array of methods, including machine learning (ML), which uses historical data to learn latent rules for future decision-making, and rule-based systems, which manipulate data according to pre-defined logical propositions.
Historical Context and Evolution
The intersection of AI and education dates back several decades, but the current wave, often associated with Industry 4.0, marks a radical shift. In the mid-20th century, instruction was entirely mechanical, relying solely on human effort. The 1970s saw the introduction of microcomputers, leading to Computer Aided Instruction (CAI). Today, the field has transitioned from basic desktop applications to embedded computer systems, humanoid robots, and web-based chatbots that can perform instructional duties independently or alongside teachers.
The "Black Box" and Machine Learning Paradigms
Understanding AIEd requires demystifying the "Black Box"—the complex internal workings of modern algorithms. There are three primary paradigms of Machine Learning:
• Supervised Learning: The machine is trained on historical data with known targets, such as predicting a student's final GPA based on demographic and attendance records.
• Unsupervised Learning: The machine performs statistical pattern recognition without pre-set labels, often used for clustering students into typologies to help design targeted supports.
• Reinforcement Learning: The system learns through a system of rewards and penalties, often used in Intelligent Tutoring Systems to decide the next best question to ask a student based on their previous answers.
The Role of Generative AI
The introduction of Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, represents a "giant leap" forward. Unlike traditional AI that simply retrieves data, generative AI produces original content, knowledge, and analysis through human-like dialogue. These systems use self-supervised learning on vast datasets to develop a statistical understanding of language, enabling them to write articles, debug code, and provide empathetic feedback.
Strategic Importance and Financial Trends
AI has become a focus of international competition, with the market for AI in education expected to grow significantly. The USA currently leads in the share of educational institutions using robots (26%), followed by Japan and the UK. In 2018 alone, US companies collected over $1.78 billion in global investments for AI-based learning, while China and India are rapidly increasing their stakes. This financial growth is driven by the belief that AI can mitigate social drawbacks by increasing knowledge accessibility and the quality of the educational process.
CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the ten primary sources identified in the research, focusing on their unique contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd). Each entry includes the paper title, author name, year of publish, publisher, and a detailed summary of its findings and methodologies.
1. Unpacking the “Black Box” of AI in Education
• Authors: Nabeel Gillani, Rebecca Eynon, Catherine Chiabaut, and Kelsey Finkel.
• Year: 2023.
• Publisher: Educational Technology & Society.
• Summary: This research addresses the problem of AI being used as a "loose umbrella term" that often hides technical limitations from stakeholders. The authors provide a fundamental overview of machine learning paradigms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. A major contribution of this work is the distinction between frequentist and Bayesian philosophies; the former relies on pattern frequencies in training data, while the latter incorporates pre-existing beliefs or "priors" to improve predictive accuracy when data is sparse. The paper warns that while deep learning—powered by neural networks—is dominant, these systems are often not transparent, making it difficult for school leaders to understand which student characteristics are driving a prediction. Ultimately, the authors call for human-centred AI that empowers those outside of computer science to interrogate and shape AI implementation.
2. From Robots to Books: An Introduction to Smart Applications of AI in Education (AIEd)
• Authors: Shubham Ojha, Siddharth Mohapatra, Aditya Narendra, and Ipsit Misra.
• Year: [Circa 2022].
• Publisher: Center of Excellence of Artificial Intelligence, Odisha University of Technology and Research.
• Summary: This study focuses on the academic and industrial standpoints of AI applications, specifically targeting Industry 4.0. The authors categorize AIEd research into four major subdomains: Teacher Workload Decrement, Adaptive Curriculum, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), and Smart Assessments. Key tools highlighted include TalkMoves, which uses NLP (BERT and LSTM) to provide teachers with personalised feedback on their classroom discourse, and GeoQA, a neural geometric solver for student doubts. The research also explores latex-based OCR, which helps educators convert complex mathematical research papers into editable text. The authors conclude that AI’s primary goal is not to replace human stakeholders but to empower them through careful implementation and policy making.
3. On the Limits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education
• Author: Neil Selwyn.
• Year: 2024.
• Publisher: Nordisk tidsskrift for pedagogikk og kritikk.
• Summary: Providing a critical perspective, Selwyn argues against the current AI hyperbole and "AI-fever" sparked by tools like ChatGPT. The paper introduces the concept of "Actually Existing AI", which focuses on the actual computational limits and IT funding flows rather than speculative sentient futures. Selwyn outlines four critical concerns: the difficulty of quantifying complex social contexts like classrooms; the risk of "allocative harms" where AI unfairly distributes resources; the loss incurred by forcing education to be "machine-readable"; and the unsustainable ecological costs of data-intensive AI models. The author advocates for slowing down and recalibrating discussions to prioritise power dynamics and resistance.
4. Artificial Intelligence in Education: A Review
• Authors: Lijia Chen, Pingping Chen, and Zhijian Lin.
• Year: 2020.
• Publisher: IEEE Access.
• Summary: This review assesses the impact of AI on administration, instruction, and learning. It traces the historical transition of AI from mechanical efforts to Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) in the 1970s, and finally to embedded systems and humanoid robots. The authors detail three essential AI models: the learner model (tracking behaviour), the knowledge model (mapping learning content), and the teaching model (determining instructional rules). The study highlights the use of "cobots" (colleague robots) that work alongside teachers to teach routine tasks such as pronunciation. It also notes that AI-based learning analytics allow institutions to act proactively by identifying students at risk of dropping out through early warning systems.
5. A Review of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education from 2010 to 2020
• Authors: Xuesong Zhai, Xiaoyan Chu, Ching Sing Chai, et al.
• Year: 2021.
• Publisher: Hindawi Complexity.
• Summary: This paper provides a systematic content analysis of 100 high-quality articles published over a decade. The authors classify research into three layers: the development layer (classification and matching algorithms), the application layer (feedback and adaptive learning), and the integration layer (affection computing and immersive learning). The review identifies emerging trends such as Swarm Intelligence, where learners shift from knowledge absorbers to creators, and Neuroscience, which uses brain-based technologies to understand a learner's physiological state. The paper concludes that while AI is promising, it faces bottlenecks in pedagogical design and ethical issues regarding data exposure.
6. AI in Education (The leap into a new era of machine intelligence)
• Author: John Bailey.
• Year: 2023.
• Publisher: American Enterprise Institute.
• Summary: Bailey focuses on the "giant leap" represent by Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Bard. The author describes these systems as "foundation models" that learn broad knowledge through self-supervised learning. A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to the importance of well-designed prompts, likening Generative AI to a "competent intern" that requires context and clear instructions to be effective. Bailey explores roles for AI as instructional assistants for students with disabilities and administrator assistants for complex tasks like school bus routing. He argues that AI is unique because it democratises machine intelligence, making powerful assistants accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
7. The future of AI and education: Some cautionary notes
• Author: Neil Selwyn.
• Year: 2022.
• Publisher: European Journal of Education (John Wiley & Sons Ltd).
• Summary: In this earlier work, Selwyn warns against "AI theatre", where companies claim to use AI while actually relying on low-tech manual procedures. He frames the adoption of AI as a political action rather than a neutral tool, noting that it often "skews strongly toward the centralisation of power". The author highlights five areas of contention: hyperbole, technical limitations, social harms, ideology, and environmental sustainability. The paper argues that AI development uses excessive energy, citing that training a single model can result in carbon emissions equivalent to those of New York City for a month. Selwyn urges the education community to resist "fait accompli" narratives and demand democratic oversight.
8. Exploring the Role of AI in Education
• Author: Nathan D. Nguyen.
• Year: 2023.
• Publisher: London Journal of Social Sciences.
• Summary: Nguyen proposes an informal grouping framework to guide AI development: Guidance, Student, and Teacher. Guidance AI assists with decision-making, such as Teacher Recommendation Systems which reduced student-teacher matching attempts from 7.22 to 3.09. Student AI focuses on quality through tools like ALEKS progress checks, which use AI to predict which topics a student is likely to forget. Teacher AI focuses on outsourcing redundant tasks, such as using essay autograders to save manual grading time. The author notes that while AI is costly, it can help close the knowledge gap if implemented with a human-centred design.
9. Role of AI in Education
• Author: Alexandara Harry.
• Year: 2023.
• Publisher: Injurity - Interdisciplinary Journal and Humanity.
• Summary: This review describes AI's potential to make learning more personalized, engaging, and efficient. It highlights Personalized Learning as the most significant advantage, allowing students to learn at their own pace. The paper discusses Chatbots as virtual tutors that provide instant feedback and automate administrative tasks like scheduling and answering FAQs. Harry cites successful implementations such as Georgia State University’s "Pounce" chatbot and Duolingo’s language practice. The research also addresses challenges like privacy risks if personal data falls into the wrong hands and the lack of trust students may have in automated grades.
10. Artificial Intelligence Application in Education: Financial Implications and Prospects
• Authors: Osetskyi V., Vitrenko A., Tatomyr I., Bilan S., and Hirnyk Ye.
• Year: 2020.
• Publisher: Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.
• Summary: This study explores the economic and financial dimensions of the AI market in education. It identifies the USA as the global leader, with 26% of its educational institutions using robots. In 2018, global investments in AI learning companies reached 51,000) and Milo ($10,000), the latter used to assist children with autism. The authors conclude that AI can mitigate social drawbacks by increasing knowledge accessibility and is a vital vector for national economic growth. They also advocate for open-source AI tools to prevent market dominance by a few "first movers".

CHAPTER 3: DIFFERENT TYPES OF APPLICATIONS
The application of AI in education is vast, ranging from backend administrative tasks to front-end student-facing interactions.
1. Instructor Workload Decrement and Teaching Support
Recent research has prioritised tools that empower teachers by reducing their non-instructional burden.
• Classroom Discourse Analysis: Applications such as TalkMoves use Natural Language Processing to provide teachers with personalised feedback on their classroom dialogue, helping them improve instructional interactions.
• Content Digitisation: AI models can perform automatic handwriting recognition, converting images of notes or assignments into digital text to assist with record-keeping and verification.
• Prerequisite Mapping: Systems like PREREQ use supervised learning to automatically identify concept-wise prerequisite relations in videos and resources, helping teachers structure their curriculum more logically.
• Latex-based OCR: Specialised AI tools can decode complex mathematical expressions from research papers into editable text, saving educators significant time when creating resources.
2. Affection Computing and Socially Assistive AI
This category focuses on the human side of learning, using AI to understand and respond to student emotions.
• Emotion Detection: AI systems can use facial recognition and textual analysis to detect a student's emotional status (e.g., frustration or boredom) and provide timely emotional feedback.
• Socially Assistive Robots (SARs): Humanoid robots are used for highly specialised tasks, such as Milo, which assists children with autism by teaching social skills and engagement in a consistent, non-threatening manner.
• Role-Playing Agents: AI agents are designed to act as companions or students (teachable agents), encouraging a "protégé effect" where students work harder and feel more responsible for the agent's learning than their own.
3. Immersive, Experiential, and Physical Learning
AI is increasingly integrated with hardware to create active training environments.
• Virtual Reality (VR) and 3D Simulation: These technologies allow students to experience experiential learning in scenarios that are difficult to replicate in a classroom, such as performing medical anatomy simulations or exploring complex landforms in geography.
• Internet of Things (IoT) in Education: Sensors and wearable devices can track human cognitive behaviours in physical contexts, such as science laboratories or construction tasks, to better match instruction with a student's physiological state.
• Educational Gamification: Advanced games like Crystal Island (microbiology) and Minecraft Edu (history) use AI to adapt the plot and interaction based on student progression and goals.
4. Institutional Governance and Logistical Management
At the macro level, AI manages the complex operations of entire school systems.
• School Choice Matching: Rule-based AI algorithms ensure equitable school placements by being "strategy-proof," preventing families with more resources from "gaming the system".
• Teacher-Student Recommendation: Systems for online one-on-one courses use compatibility matching based on academic history, which has been shown to reduce the number of student matching attempts significantly.
• Administrative sentiment analysis: Administrators can use Large Language Models to perform sentiment analysis on survey data, gaining a sophisticated understanding of the school climate.
5. Specialised STEM and Language Support
Specialised platforms use AI to address specific subject-matter challenges.
• Automated STEM Checks: Programs like ALEKS use AI to predict which topics a student is likely to forget, specifically timing "progress checks" to maximise long-term learning gain.
• Language Learning Tutors: Start-ups such as Liulishuo use advanced AI to teach English to millions of students, adapting to their proficiency level and learning style in real-time.
• Intelligent Question-Answering (Q&A): Systems based on knowledge graphs can quickly answer high-school student questions while simultaneously connecting those questions to related knowledge points for deeper understanding.

CONCLUSION

Summary of Findings
The current state of AIEd is one of high promise and significant challenge. AI has successfully permeated administration, instruction, and learning, offering unprecedented opportunities for personalisation and efficiency. However, the field must move beyond "AI theatre" to focus on the actual computational limits and social impacts of these technologies.
Future Research Trends
Several emerging areas are set to define the next generation of AIEd:
• Neuroscience and Deep Learning: Future research may integrate brain-based educational technologies with deep learning to better understand the physiological states of learners and optimize guidance.
• Swarm Intelligence: This decentralized approach may disrupt traditional roles, turning learners from knowledge absorbers into creators within a collaborative curriculum.
• Internet of Things (IoT): Wearable computing devices and sensors could be used to sense and understand human cognitive behaviours in physical contexts, such as science labs.
The Human-Centred Future
Crucially, the goal of AI should not be to replace human stakeholders but to empower them. Human interaction remains vital for providing emotional support, motivation, and the teaching of "soft skills" like leadership and critical thinking, which AI currently struggles to replicate. For AIEd to truly improve the human condition, it must be developed with transparency, fairness, and inclusion at its core, involving educators in every step of the design and implementation process.
